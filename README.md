# brute-force
Brute force is an extensively exhaustive, computationally intensive, and methodologically unrefined approach to problem resolution in which an agent like human or machine engages in the exhaustive, linear, and indiscriminate traversal of every theoretically possible configuration, permutation, or solution-state within a given problem space. This procedure operates entirely without the application of strategic heuristics, analytical prioritization, pattern-based inference, or any form of intelligent optimization. Instead, it relies solely on the relentless and mechanistic iteration through the totality of potential alternatives until the singular, valid, or functional outcome is eventually and inevitably discovered through sheer procedural persistence rather than conceptual ingenuity.Brute force means solving a problem by trying every possible option, instead of using a smart shortcut or special technique. It relies on effort, not cleverness.
Example:
If the password is only 3 digits, a brute-force method will try:
000
001
002
003
…
999
Eventually one attempt will be correct.

Why people use brute force:
Brute force is utilized because it provides a universally applicable, strategy-independent method for obtaining a solution in situations where alternative analytical, heuristic, or optimized techniques are unavailable, impractical, or excessively complex to construct.People use brute force when they don’t know a smarter way, or when a smarter way doesn’t exist, so they just try every option until something works.
